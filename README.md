This is the matlab source code for our paper published in Plosone in 2016, "Retrieval of Brain Tumors by Adaptive Spatial Pooling and Fisher Vector Representation".

The two main programs you need to run begin with "main_". Before running the code, you need to:
1. dowload the image data and uncompress them into the folder "imageData". You can download the data from [here](https://figshare.com/articles/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427).
2. Compile the vlfeat package following the instructions on vlfeat website (http://www.vlfeat.org/install-matlab.html). The vlfeat package is already included in this project.

The code is annotated. Have fun and good luck!
